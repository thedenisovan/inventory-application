# Entrepreneur Managing Web Application

This backend learning project was created to solidify my knowledge in Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and EJS.  
It also uses the following packages:

- express-validator  
- dotenv  
- nodemon  
- pg  

## Features

- Full CRUD operations for all tables on the site.  
- Automatic creation of relationship rows when adding a new entrepreneur or business, showing the entrepreneur's role.
